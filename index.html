        <h1>About </h1>
        <p>&nbspNinja Saga has been around for the past 11 years since July 2009. Unfortunately 
            this game is going to come to an end due to Facebook no longer support on  
            Adobe Flash Games. However, they may find a new software to run this game on facebook or etc.
            I've created this static website to keep all my remaining lighting style in the event if the developer 
            doesn't intend to invest in the game anymore or restart everything again. 
            I've started the game since 2010 and i have only joined one clan for the entire game.
            I've spend most of the time in PVP and Lighting is probably the only element that I've 
            been using to knock down opponents.

        <h1>Avatar</h1>
<p>&nbspThe creation of my Lighting Avatars was being inspired by the art of susanoo from Naruto manga
    and Genos the cybord from OPM manga. The Lighting Avatars that I've created was mainly to focus on pure critical damage. 
    It has a substantial amount of critical damage, strong enough to defeat an opponent with a single blow.
    I've created four types of lighting avatars that processes different lighting and critical abilities. Click on "My Avatar"
    on the top or scroll down. You will see four types of avatars, click on them and it will bring you to thier video and stats.
    Just throw the yellow flash kunai to go to top. 
</p>

 <h1>Lighting Ethics</h1>
 <p> &nbspThe ethics of my avatar fighting skills is not to lock the opponent down with a rigid win
    but rather to allow oppnents to demonstrate thier fighting abilities. Lock, stun, chaos or 
   whatever that stops the opponent would only be used in the event of surviving without any other
choices. Being a lighting user is not easy because you have be very patient without much support from 
purify and agility, that's the cost of critical. The lighting journey in PVP will always meet 
some first locker that's desparately wish to win you over a cheap and rigid match. 

<br> <br> <span style="color: green;">&nbspTo the ethical players:
    " If you are a person that start a match without locking and win, you are highly respected in the match as you have shown
    your greatest abilities. Probably you are a space time user or significant defence and constant purify with heavily equipped
    clan skills and weapons "
<br> <br>
    "However, if you had lost in the battle that would probably be the fate of Ninja Saga algorithm"
</span>  


<br> <br> <span style="color: red;">&nbspTo the first locker:
    " If you have clan skill, bushin and defer and you are still doing first lock on your opponent. Please do yourself a favor, remove
    your hand from the keyboard, use it to slap your face and look a the mirror and Say, SHAME ON YOU. "
<br> <br>
    "However, if even with those skills and first lock and you still lose in the battle, probably is time to understand that desperation to win would
    bring you to no way and no meaning"
</span>  </p>

                <p>&nbspThe Rokubi Armor set was available around the early 2018. This 
                    out fit represents the lighting armor as similar to the nature attribute of pet rokubi. This is a 
                    full attack avatar.  
                <br><br>
                &nbspThe Roku armor was design to settle a quick fight in the battle. This avatar processes a significant 
                high chance of critical damage that could easily penetrate through shields buff with additional 
                critical support of the back item of his ruko tail. The unique abilities of this avatar fighting style is effortless
                on producing critical damage without needed to buff. However, the Roku set doesn't processed
                enough deffence, CP and HP that usually doesn't end well if the battle continue to drag longer.
