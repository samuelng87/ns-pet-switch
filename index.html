        <h1>PVP </h1>
        <p>&nbspNinja Saga has been around for the past 11 years since July 2009. They had sucessfully confirm that this game will move to Unity.
            I've created this static website to keep all my remaining lighting style in the event if the developer intend to
            restart everything again. I've started the game since 2010 and i have only joined one clan for the entire game.
            I've spend most of the time in PVP and Lighting is probably the only element that I've 
            been using to knock down opponents.
        </p>

        <p><span style="color: red;"> NOTE : Better experience by using larger screen, this means using your computer or laptop instead of Smartphones
        </span></p>
   

        <h1>Avatar</h1>
<p>&nbspThe creation of my Lighting Avatars was being inspired by the art of susanoo from Naruto manga
    and Genos the cybord from OPM manga. The Lighting Avatars that I've created was mainly to focus on pure critical damage. 
    It has a substantial amount of critical damage, strong enough to defeat an opponent with a single blow.
    I've created four types of lighting avatars that processes different lighting and critical abilities. Click on "My Avatar"
    on the top or scroll down. You will see four types of avatars, click on them and it will bring you to thier video and stats.
    Just throw the yellow flash kunai if you wanted to go back to the top. 
</p>

 <h1>Lighting Ethics</h1>
 <p> &nbspThe ethics of my avatar fighting skills is not to lock the opponent down with a rigid win
    but rather to allow oppnents to demonstrate thier fighting abilities. Lock, stun, chaos or 
   whatever that stops the opponent would only be used in the event for surviving without any other alternative
choice. Being a lighting user is not easy because you have to be very patient without much support from 
purify and agility, that's the cost of critical. Only a few of lighting user would probably be around in PVP 
hated from the unique abilities of your fighting style. The lighting journey in PVP will always meet 
some first locker that desparately wish to win you over a cheap and rigid match. 

<br> <br> <span style="color: green;">&nbspTo the ethical players:
    " If you are a person that start a match without first locking and win, you are highly respected in the match as you have shown
    your greatest abilities. Probably you are a space time user or significant defence and constant purify with heavily equipped
    clan skills and weapons "
<br> <br>
    "However, if you had lost in the battle that would probably be the fate of Ninja Saga algorithm". Remember, sometimes you are not 
    controlling the game, the game is controlling you.
</span>  


<br> <br> <span style="color: red;">&nbspTo the first locker:
    " If you have clan skill, bushin and defer and you are still doing first lock on your opponent. Please do yourself a favor, remove
    your hand from the keyboard, use it to slap your face and look a the mirror and Say, SHAME ON YOU. "
<br> <br>
    "However, if even with those skills and first lock and you still lose in the battle, probably is time to understand that desperation to win would
    bring you to no way and no meaning in the battle"
</span>  </p>

            <br><br>
            &nbspThere are a lot of first locker out there in PVP. They are desparate to win over 
            a cheap fight by locking you up the first turn and end you with an ASI when you use defer after unyielding.  
        <br><br>
        &nbspThis avatar was design to survive on an ASI blast while you regenerate after unyielding 
         with a combination of Yobi support. He has great regenaration of HP and CP to continue producing 
         skills even when recieve few blows of CP reduction from opponents.

                <p>&nbspThe Rokubi Armor set was available around the early 2018. This 
                    outfit represents the lighting armor as similar to the nature attribute of pet rokubi. This is a 
                    full attack avatar.  
                <br><br>
                &nbspThe Roku armor was design to settle a quick fight in the battle. This avatar processes a significant 
                high chance of critical damage that could easily penetrate through shields buff with additional 
                critical support of the back item of his ruko tail. The unique abilities of this avatar fighting style is effortless
                on producing critical damage without needed to buff. However, the Roku set doesn't processed
                enough deffence, CP and HP that usually doesn't end well if the battle continue to drag longer.
